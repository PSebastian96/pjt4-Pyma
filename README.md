# Introduction

Welcome to my fourth project milestone's readme file!

Pyma Snacks is a fictional company that is producing healthy snack alternatives for people who are concerned about the environment and want to contribute to environmental causes by supporting eco-friendly food producing companies.

This project is part of the fourth milestone project within the course from City of Bristol College in partnership with Code Institute.

The fourth milestone project's objective is to make a full-stack web application, that contains frontend and backend technologies with the backend: python and Django framework. The objective of this segment of the course is to create a e-commerce website, where users can register, create a shopping bag, edit the sopping bag and create and order.

This enables to create a fully functional e-commerce website, where users can join a website and interact with the content found on the website.

# Deployment
<details>
  <summary><h2>How to Clone</h2></summary>
1. Click the Code button to the left of the green Gitpod button, then choose Local.
2. Click on headings for HTTPS, SSH, and Github CLI to find their individual URL links. Choose the HTTPs one.
3. Open your own terminal in your editor and change the current working directory to the location of where you want the cloned directory to be.
4. In the terminal type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied from the repository page.
Press enter to start the process.
5. To install the packages required by the application use the command : pip install -r requirements.txt
6. When developing and running the application locally set DEBUG=True in the settings.py file
Modifications performed on the local clone can be synchronized with the repository by executing the following commands:
git add filenames (or "." to add all changed files)
git commit -m "your message"
git push Modifications pushed to the main branch will be implemented in the live project after re-deployment from Heroku. Ensure that you do not include DEBUG=True in the settings.py file on GitHub; this setting is intended exclusively for local use.
